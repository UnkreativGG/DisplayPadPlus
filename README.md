Hello there

I don't work on this project anymore, so do with it what ever you want.

---

I startet it some time ago, when Mountain released their Display Pad SDK: https://github.com/Mountain-BC/DisplayPad.SDK.Demo

I had the goal to make a simple lib where I could configure my display pad quickly via code.

For that I decompiled and modified the lib by mountain.

How ever, I quit, as I have more fun developing in C++ and I'm to dump to translate the core lib into c++, so I quit some time ago.

If you want to continue development, have fun!
